# Changelog

Major changes and improvements in each release of cinq, newest first.

## Unreleased

- Problems in `config.toml` show on standard error each time that cinq
  reads the file, at startup and on each change, with the lines around each
  problem and its place marked, and the sidebar gives the line of each.  On
  a terminal, only the problems of the latest reading stay on screen, so
  that fixing the file clears it, and a file without problems prints
  nothing.
